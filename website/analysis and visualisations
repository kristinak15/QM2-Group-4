PART 1: Economic variables, agriculture and GM crops

Finding data, choosing variables and normalising. 
- Best way to represent economic effects and output is GDP. Used agriculture GDP because it is more relevant for crop production
- Limitations of data: only certain states available, time series data and other factors that can influence GDP (prices, exports, rural population)
- Visualisation: data table

Exploring the data (Use raw data or normalised?)
- Visualisations: two-variate scatter plots (Yield and GM corn, Agri GDP and GM corn, Agri GDP and export/employment), correlation heatmap, big sns multivariate plot with histogram, multiple linear regression
- Analysis: 

Context and state comparison using maps
- Visualisation: Historic interactive map for Agri GDP and GM corn
