1. Analyse the relationship between economic output and the production of Genetically Modified (GM) crops 
We aim to explore the correlation between GM corn acreage and Agricultural GDP by state.

2. Address misinformation by looking at the trends in the public opinion regarding GMOs in the United States
As a very controvercial topic, we aim to dissuade common myths regarding GM crops and present the current state of agriculture and GM crops using data and maps.
 
3. Create a base for future exploration in other countries 
Genetically modified crops have potential for economic growth and can address many other issues, especially in developing countries. We hope that our findings raise awareness and are a starting point for future research and debate.
