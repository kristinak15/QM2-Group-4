#GMO EXPLANATION#

Before we get into the heart of the research project, let us explain what GMOs are. 

Genetically Modified Organisms, also know as GMOs, are organisms which DNA has been altered through engineering techniques.
These techniques are generally applied to bacteria, animals, virus but for the purpose of our research question, we will focus on the use of GMOs in agriculture i.e. plants. 
Generally, the process to create a GMO plant starts with the identification of a desired trait that a plant lacks, such as insect reistance on rapid growth. 
The next step is to find an organism, another plant, which naturally has the gene that allows the needed trait to develop. 
Once the gene with the desired trait is identified, it is copied by scientist and inserted into the initial plant. The latter is grown, and should in theory have all its biological characteristics and ultimately the new said trait.
This method, developed in the 1970s, might seem like science-fiction, but it is not too different, in principle, from traditional selective breeing and cross-breeding farmers
have been putting into action for centuries. However, these traditional practices take a long time and may not always present optimal results, whereas genetic engineering allows
specific changes in a shorter period of time. 
Another method, discovered in the last decade is CRISPR editing. Roughly, it allows DNA fractions within an organism to be modified or deleted, in order to alter gene functions. 
CRISPR editing employs an external protein, from the CRISPR-Cas9 bacteria, that can modify foreign DNA. It is a very powerful tool towards more precise gene editing. 

#OUR MOTIVATIONS#


The question that our group aims to answer encompasses the interests we respectively had in economics, genetics, science policy and sustainability. 
Our focus in the USA is explained by the fact that the USA has been the number one producer of GM crops since 1994.
Despite the controversies lying behind GM crops and the multiple debates regarding the technique's safety, this new technology can trigger substantial socio-economic advantages, environmental benefits and improvements in food security. 
Decisions regarding emerging technologies such as GM crops often omit to take into consideration the public opinion towards the technology's implementation, which often tends to produce unintended or unwanted consequences.
In addition, the general public often has limited information regarding GM crops despite its growing implementation in the United States. 
One of the reasons the question of GM crops is pertinent is the FAO 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as part of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals.
The SDG agenda aims to end poverty, hunger and malnutrition and enable sustainable development in agriculture, fisheries and forestry. In this context, GM crops is a new technology,
which could have a significant potential in addressing the challenges of sustainable development such as pest and diseases, drought, malnutrition
and food insecurity, notably in developing countries.

Therefore, we want to examine the correlations between socioeconomic factors by state and the production of GM crops to examine to which extent the impact
of GMO plants in agriculture is positive. In addition, we aim to analyse the correlations between public opinion and GM crop production by state.
