Before we get into the heart of the research project, let us explain what GMOs are. 

Genetically Modified Organisms also know as GMOs are organisms which DNA has been altered through engineering techniques.
This techniques are applied to bacteria, animals, virus but for the purpose of our research question, we are going to focus on the use of GMOs in agriculture i.e. plants. 
Generally, the process to create a GMO plant starts with the identification of a desired trait that a plant lacks, such as insect reistance on rapid growth. 
The next step is to find an organism, another plant, that naturally has said trait meaning there exists a gene allowing that trait to develop. 
After the gene with the desired trait is identifies, it is copied by scientist and inserted into the initial plant. The latter is grown, and in theory, 
should have all its biological characteristics as well as the new desired trait.
This method, developed in the 1970s, might seem like science-fiction, but it is not too different, in principle, from traditional selective breeing and cross-breeding farmers
have been putting into action for centuries. However, these traditional take a long time and may not present good results, whereas genetic engineering allows
specific changes in a shorter period of time. 
Another method, discovered in the last decade is CRISPR editing. Roughly, it allows DNA fractions within an organism to be modified or deleted, in order to alter gene functions. 
CRISPR editing employs an external protein, from the CRISPR-Cas9 bacteria, that can modify foreign DNA. CRISPR editing is a very powerful tool towards more precise gene editing.
