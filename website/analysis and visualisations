PART 1: Economic variables, agriculture and GM crops

Finding data, choosing variables and normalising. 
- Best way to represent economic effects and output is GDP. Used agriculture GDP because it is more relevant for crop production
- Limitations of data: only certain states available, time series data and other factors that can influence GDP (prices, exports, rural population)
- Normalised data by dividing the x-variables by agriculture land operated by state, as well as to have in the same order of magnitude and took log of employment in agriculture
- Visualisation: data table, stacked bar blot for GM corn across states 

Exploring the data 
- Visualisations: two-variate scatter plots (Yield and GM corn, Agri GDP and GM corn, Agri GDP and export/employment), correlation heatmap, big sns multivariate plot with histogram, panel linear regression
- Analysis: 

Context and state comparison using maps
- Visualisation: Historic interactive map for Agri GDP and GM corn

PART 2: Public opinion and GM crops

- Google trends used for public engagement with the topic over chosen period of time. 
  limitations: not representative of the sentiment of the people, no exact number of searches, rather gives an idea of when the search peaks were
  we then looked for important dates for the technology of GMOs (legislation, regulations, marches agaisnt big companies etc.) and looked for the relationship 
  between the dates and the search trends.
  visualisations: search trends overlayed with key dates
  
- Around 200 tweets collected from the twitter API, in the USA and mentioning "GMO"
  limitations: small sample, inaccuracy in the term and how people use it in tweets in comparison with our project
  visualisations: nlkt plots with 20 most used nouns, verbs and adjectives, (collocations?)
