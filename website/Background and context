#GMO EXPLANATION#

Before we get into the heart of the research project, let us explain what GMOs are. 

Genetically Modified Organisms also know as GMOs are organisms which DNA has been altered through engineering techniques.
This techniques are applied to bacteria, animals, virus but for the purpose of our research question, we are going to focus on the use of GMOs in agriculture i.e. plants. 
Generally, the process to create a GMO plant starts with the identification of a desired trait that a plant lacks, such as insect reistance on rapid growth. 
The next step is to find an organism, another plant, that naturally has said trait meaning there exists a gene allowing that trait to develop. 
After the gene with the desired trait is identifies, it is copied by scientist and inserted into the initial plant. The latter is grown, and in theory, 
should have all its biological characteristics as well as the new desired trait.
This method, developed in the 1970s, might seem like science-fiction, but it is not too different, in principle, from traditional selective breeing and cross-breeding farmers
have been putting into action for centuries. However, these traditional take a long time and may not present good results, whereas genetic engineering allows
specific changes in a shorter period of time. 
Another method, discovered in the last decade is CRISPR editing. Roughly, it allows DNA fractions within an organism to be modified or deleted, in order to alter gene functions. 
CRISPR editing employs an external protein, from the CRISPR-Cas9 bacteria, that can modify foreign DNA. CRISPR editing is a very powerful tool towards more precise gene editing. 

#OUR MOTIVATIONS#


The question that our group aims to answer include the interests we had in economics, genetics, science policy and sustainability. 
Our focus in the USA is explained by the fact that the USA has been the number one producer of GM crops since 1994.
Despite the controversies behind GM crops and debates regarding safety, the new technology has many potential socio-economic, environmental benefits and improvements in food security. 
Decisions regarding emerging technologies such as GM crops often do not take into consideration public opinion, thus often leading to unintended or unwanted consequences.
In addition, the general public often has limited information regarding GM crops despite its growing implementation in the United States. 
One of the reasons the question of GM crops is pertinent is the FAO 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as part of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals.
The SDG agenda aims to end poverty, hunger and malnutrition and enable sustainable development in agriculture, fisheries and forestry. GM crops is a new technology,
which could help address these goals and has diverse potentials in addressing the challenges of sustainable development such as pest and diseases, drought, malnutrition
and food insecurity, in developing countries.

Therefore, we want to examine the correlations between (socio)economic factors by state and the production of GM crops to examine to which extent the impact
of GMO plants in agriculture is positive. In addition, we want to analyse the correlations between public opinion and GM crop production by state.
