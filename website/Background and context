Before we get into the heart of the research project, let us explain what GMOs are. 

Genetically Modified Organisms also know as GMOs are organisms which DNA has been altered through engineering techniques. Generally, this means that a section 
of DNA is added from an organism to another, for specific desired traints. It can also mean tha DNA sections have been deleted or modified within an organism using CRISPR 
editing for instance. For the purpose of our research question, we are going to focus on the use of GMOs in agriculture.
