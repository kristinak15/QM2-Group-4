google trend data from the 1st of December 2010 until 1st December 2020 on search "GMO"
We are not basing our analysis on google trends, we just thought it was interesting to see when the peaks of searches for the term “GMO” happened, 
it there was a connection between those dates and important dates in the field, and if so whether they were fake news, protests, science improvement
annunciations etc. 

We will consider 70 and above to be a considerable number of searches, based on the google trend unit system. (downloaded data from google trends)
100: June 2013
90-99: May 2013, May 2014, October 2014, November 2014
80-89: April 2013, January 2014, April 2015, May 2015
70-79: March 2013, October 2013, November 2013, February 2014, March 2014, February 2015, March 2015, March 2013

2015: FDA approves an application for the first genetic modification in an animal for use as food, a genetically engineered salmon. 

2016: Congress passes a law requiring labelling for some foods produces through genetic engineering and uses the term “bioengineered”,
which will start to appear on some foods. 

2017: GMO apples are available for sale in the U.S. 

2019: FDA completed consultation on first food from genome edited plant 

We can deduce that the scientific and policy advancements in the years 2016, 2017 and 2019 did not considerably affect the number of searches.
While the high number of searches during some months of 2015 might be related to the 2015 event.

1 May 2015, CRISPR editing: First report of genes edited in human embryos ignited global debate about gene editing technology (Huang, Liang, Xu, Zhang)

However, these dates provided by the FDA and the CRISPR timeline do not explain the high relative interest rate in 2014 and most importantly 2013. 

After doing some research, we found that some important events regarding GMOs occurred during the spring of 2013, when searches were relatively high. 
Firstly, there was the Bowman vs. Monsanto supreme court hearing, during which Monsanto sued a farmer from Indiana for patent infringement (limited use
license not respected). The supreme court rules that Bowman’s conduct infringed Monsanto’s patents. 
Additionally, the march against Monsanto took place in May 2015, and allowed advocates to protest against the failure of California Proposition 37, which 
would require 
labelling food products made from GMOs. Events took place in more than 300 cities around the world, mostly in the USA.
